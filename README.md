# Algiers Transit Data

This project aims to provide the transit data for Algiers in an open format. This includes:
- bus stop locations
- timetables
- routes/lines

Note that only data regarding the ETUSA[1] network are taken into account.

## Some Background
Back in 2012, we gathered data in different formats from ETUSA itself. This data was not clean, nor processed, and hardly machine-readable. Since then, we worked on getting this data in a standard, open format that could be enriched and used by developers, enthusiasts and so on. There is still a lot of work to be done, and our hope is that this project will be further developed by the community.
